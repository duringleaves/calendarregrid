Scripts to attempt to rearrange old calendar grids for new years.

As I remastered the 1990 Pee Wee's Playhouse calendar for 2026, I developed a few scripts in an attempt to help.  Neither are perfect, but maybe they'll help someone else.

arr_grids.py

A simple script that attempts to identify the square outlines of each day, then shuffle all days forward or backward a number of steps, to match the day configuration of your preferred year.  It works... okay.  It took a lot of hand editing, but eventually I got it.

extract_calendar_cells.py

A little more interactive in that you can drag lines to indicate where to separate the daily squares, then export them into individual files.  This would then let you use those squares to generate any sort of configuration (daily, weekly, monthly, etc) that you wanted.
